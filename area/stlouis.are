A Small Pond in the Woods~
Pushing the branches out of your way you stumble into a small glen hidden
deep in within the heart of the Miden'nir.  Little batches of flowers trace
along the edges of a limpid pond with water almost clear enough to see to
the bottom.  Small woodland creatures sit at the banks drinking the pure,
clean water untainted by civilization.  Looking further into the pond you
notice it seems to be glowing a slight blue at the bottom.

You seem to be on the side of a road of some sorts.  Cars speed by you
all heading to or from a large city in the south.  The side of the road is
littered with garbage and a sign reading 'I 70'.  Above you you see a
shimmering blue portal which, it seems, noone but you can see.

Walking into town you see a large sign reading 'Welcome to Saint Louis'
with several of the towns crests and awards posted on it.  It seems you've
came into town through the back as you approach the redlight district to the
south.  A billboard catches you eye proclaiming equal rights for
supernatural creatures sponsered by the Church of Eternal Life.

The Redlight District~
Oh my!  This certainly isnt the most tasteful of greetings upon your
arrival.  Here the streets are littered with prostitutes and neon signs.  No
matter your tastes or preference, here you can find anything you need.  The
amount of drugs here is so potent you can smell it wafting from the crowd as
you walk by brothels and opium bars.  To the south the atmosphere seems to
get a bit better, and alot more tasteful.

heads.  The Cafe itself is packed wall to wall with people all laughing and
enjoying their respective drinks.  To the north theres a rather large
curtain covering what appears to be a door.

Louis.  Marx Way continues east and west while to the south theres a club
called 'The Laughing Corpse' and one to the north titled 'Guilty Pleasures'

Among the various kinds of alcohol are bottles filled with a deep red
liquid.  Up on stage theres a man doing a comedy bit with a reanimated
zombie.

You walk upon a most unsettling scene.  A woman is standing over a grave
within a circle of blood raising a corpse from the earth with the power of
her voice.  Several men in suits stand around her watching a preparing
papers for the corpse to sign that he never got to in life.  The family of
the poor reanimated man watch in terror as their husband, their father
crawls from the dirt in attempt to live again.  They know that within the
hour he'll be put back never to rise again.

Walking into the Apartment complex you notice a elderly woman walking her
dog which looks like a cross between and pom-pom and a feather duster.  And
just ahead is a handsome man sitting against Anita Blake's door waiting for
her to come home.
