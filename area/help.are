-1 LORDSOFWAR LORDS SAGE~
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Lords of War code was created by Sage, Lords of War is written on
God Wars which was created by KaVir. I would like to thank the 
following people. This is in order of how much they helped me.

-KaVir for making the God Wars code for me to work off.
-Order for being a good friend and helping me to create low 4.
-Malawar for his cool additions.
-Tijer for helping me with the finishing touches.
-Dunkirk for code help.
-Sirmog for code help.
-The players for inspiring me.
-The Merc/Diku team for making the code base.

This mud is dedicated to KaVir for his hard work. KaVir aka Richard
Woolcock has spent more time then you can imagine making muds for
players to play. God Wars, Dark City, God Wars Deluxe, and now Last
City. Every time you play a God Wars mud try and take some time
and rember who made it all possible. This mud is not a very good
dedication seeing as it is not the perfect mud, but it is the best
I could do at the moment. KaVir is a great coder and most of all
a great person. I would like to say Thanks KaVir!
-Sage
Rember don't ever become like (POH), the stolen orginal Lords of War
code renamed. The mud is an insult to all coders and players due
to his lack of respect. This mud was coded for you players, rember
that. Much time and work went into this game for you. Enjoy.
This code is ftpable from ftp.game.org. Please read and follow the
low.txt, merc.txt and godwars.txt I have enclosed. If these are not
followed you are running an illegal mud. Have fun! :) Sage

0 WAR STARTWAR ENDWAR WARSTATS JOINWAR ELIMINATE~
There are two types of War:

          1. Last Man Standing:   Basically, this war goes on until
                                  there is only one person remaining.
                                  Players receive a reward for each
                                  person eliminated, and the winner
                                  gets a bonus.

          2. Team Deathmatch:     Two teams duke it out in the style
                                  of Last Man Standing. Players are
                                  divided between two teams, and the
                                  team that survives the war wins.

To join a war, type '#wJoinWar#n' when an immortal starts the countdown.

Monks are servants of God. They are masters of the body and spirit.
Defensive in nature, a monk spends his or her life practicing the mystical
arts. God grants monks special abilities that allow them to compete with the
evil Supernatual creatures they aim to smite.

0 MONKCHI~

A monk's chi is the essential part of combat.  The higher
the monk's chi, the better he or she can parry and dodge
blows.  It also gives the monk more strength and power,
thus letting him or her inflict more damage and receive
less.  Maintaining chi is very strenuous, and requires
that the monk have plenty of vitality.
~

0 MONKCOMBO~

By using his or her special techniques, such as thrust kick,
in a certain order, he or she may perform special combos.
Each combo has a different effect.  Some may do damage to the
victim, some syphon movement points, and some may stun the victim.
A monk's combos are a very mysterious thing, thus the monk
must spend much of his or her life trying to perfect
these combos.
~

0 MONKBLOCK~

A monk's block counter allows him to parry blows much better.
This counter increments whenever a monk parries a blow.
The max block counter is 150, and the higher it gets, the
better the monk parries.  After the fight stops, the block
counter will soon reset to 0.
~

0 MONKFOCUS~

Elite monks have the ability to focus the power of God
into his or her own special attacks.  After a monk has
gained focus points, he or she must use them to perform
special attacks that have devastating effects.  The only
downside to these attacks is that it takes a monk a
very long time to recover the focus required to do such
extraordinary feats.
~

0 MONKABILITIES~
Monks have four special abilities granted to them by God.
Each ability has four levels, which cost 500k exp each.
For more info on the Abilities,
See Help: 'MONKSPIRIT' 'MONKCOMBAT' 'MONKBODY' and 'MONKAWARENESS'
~

0 MONKSPIRIT~

Level 1 - Blinding Agony. This power allows the monk to hurl
a ball of pure evil at a foe.  It blinds the foe, and prevents
him or her to flee or recall.

Level 2 - Natural Harmony (auto).  This power allows the monk to
absorb the evil of someone who attacks him or her and channel
them into energy, which heals the Monk.

Level 3 - Healing Touch.  This power allows the monk to imbue his
target with the essence of God, healing his or her wounds.

Level 4 - Death Touch. This power allows the monk to give his victim a
deadly disease which cripples and wounds him or her.

0 MONKAWARENESS~

Level 1 - Nightsight

Level 2 - Shadowsight

Level 3 - Truesight

Level 4 - Scry
~

0 MONKBODY~

Level 1 - Adamantium Hands.  This power allows the monk's hands to become
incredibly hard, like adamantium.  This allows the monk to do more damage
and parry blows with his or her bare hands.

Level 2 - Body of Stone (Auto).  At this mastery of the body, the monk's
body is as hard as a stone, causing him or her to take reduced damage.

Level 3 - Spiritpower.  This power allows the monk to channel his or her
energy into offensive attacks, significantly raising his or her hitroll
and damroll.

Level 4 - The Glow (Auto).  Only a true master of the body has this
ability.  The monk's power is so great that his or her hands glow
brightly with the power of God and the monk's holy spirit.  The 
effect of this glow is varied, but often dangerous.
~

0 MONKCOMBAT~

This ability improves the monk's combat ability per level.
Each level gives the monk more knowledge of combat,
allowing him or her to do more damage, hit more often, and
parry and dodge more.
~

0 MONKCOUNTER~

The monk's block counter is a very important part of a monk's blocking.
The block counter increases everytime a monk parries a blow.  The
higher a monk's block counter, the better the monk can parry blows.
The block counter resets shortly after fights.

the Wyrm, who spreads its cancer through the humans. They are the preservers
of the raw essence of life, of nature's diversity and purity. They are the

0 BREED BREEDS~
#0-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-#n
A werewolf's breed is their natural form. Breed gifts often originate 
in spirits who owe the breed a favour for some kindness or help in the
past.  

Homid : This is the human face of the Garou. When they walk amoung men. 
Lupus : The Garou's natural form is a wolf.
Metis : This is a result of doing what is forbidden. When two Garou 
        reproduce they produce metis. The natural form of the metis
        is the feared crinos form; the man wolf killing machine form.

0 VAMPIRE VAMPIRES KINDRED~
#0-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-#n
Vampires are the creatures of the night and thus take damage if exposed to
daylight. Vampires cannot eat food, or drink any liquids except for blood.
If they cannot drink blood for a long duration of time they will start 
taking damage or maybe even go berserk, so it's a good idea to store some
blood in a drinking container.  Vampires take half damage from cold, none 
from gas, and double from fire, although those with the Heat immunity
take normal fire damage rather than double.  Other abilities:

* Fangs - Gives a free bite attack in combat, and required to 'bite' people.
* Bite - Transforms target into a vampire, but costs the vampire 1000 exp.
* Order - As if target lower generation vampire of your clan was charmed.
* Introduce - Informs everyone in the room of your vampire lineage.
* Vamptalk - A special vampire channel which distinguishes between clans.
* Regenerate - Vampire cannot regenerate naturally; they need to use this.
* Vclan - Shows information on the other members of a vampires clan.
* Feed - For feeding other vampires with your blood.
* Favour - Make a vampire a Prince, allow them to sire a childe, accepts 
  or inducts them into the clan, or outcasts them from the clan.
* Embrace - Vampires use this to gain blood.
* Clandisc - Shows all disciplines you have.
* Powers - Shows what powers you have and also the command names for them.
In addition, all vampires disciplines, each of which grant one or more 
extra powers.  For more information type 'help disciplines'.
The DEFENCE command toggles on/off whether vampires may bite/feed you.

~

0 BEAST~

Vampires, like mortals, are creatures of instinct.  However, the 
instincts of the vampire are those of a hunter, not a gatherer.  Vampires 
are the ultimate predators and stand at the apex of the food chain.  
They are highly developed killing machines - the harbringers of death.
For vampires to survive in modern society, however, they must learn to 
keep the Beast in check.  The instincts of violence (the Beast) so 
essential in the wild serve only to endanger the vampire in today's 
complex world.  The Beast's rage has its uses, but the blindness it 
creates far outweighs its benefits.
Vampires struggle to suppress the Beast, but, no matter how hard they 
try, they do not always prevail, and when it gets loose, the havoc it 
creates goes far beyond the horror of any mortal rage.
~

0 FAVOUR SIRE PRINCE~
Syntax: favour <target> <sire/prince>

Favour is an ability available to second generation vampires and vampire 
princes.

SIRE allows the target vampire of your clan to sire another vampire.  
Once a single vampire has been created the power is lost, but can be 
granted again if the Antediluvian or Prince so desire.  A childe sired 
without permission is known as an Anarch.

PRINCE turns the target vampire into a prince, who is then able to allow 
other vampires the ability to sire more vampires still.  Only an 
Antediluvian has the power to make some a prince (or to remove the 
prince's powers).

ACCEPT will accept a childe into the clan, making them a Neonate.

INDUCT and OUTCAST will accept an Anarch into the clan or outcast a member.
~

0 DISCIPLINE DISCIPLINES~

Each vampire clan has three disciplines from which their powers come.  In 
addition to these basic three, vampires may learn additional disciplines 
from other vampires.  Only the single clan discipline is passed on to
later generations.  Each Discipline has several power levels and each
level must be learnt before the next can be gained.

Vampires can learn and discipline up to 4 but can only raise a a certain
number up to 5. The number of Disciplines a vampire can raise is based
on 3 things:

Age, Status and Generation.

The max number ANY vampire can get to 5 is 15.

There are twenty disciplines, each with the following powers:

* Animalism     - Control over Animals
* Auspex        - Extra sensory powers
* Celerity      - Great combat speed
* Chimerstry    - Illusionary powers
* Daiminion     - Demonic gifts
* Dominate      - Hypnotic powers
* Fortitude     - Damage resistance
* Melpominee    - Power of the voice
* Necromancy    - Mastery over the dead
* Obeah         - Healing and purity
* Obfuscate     - Art of concealment
* Obtenebration - Shadow magic
* Potence       - Supernatural strength
* Presence      - Charismatic aura's
* Protean       - Shapeshifting

For more information, type 'help <discipline name>'.
~

0 PROTEAN~

This Discipline allows a vampire to transform either their entire body or 
a part of their body into something inhuman.  The vampire can thus grow 
claws, turn into a bat, transform into a wolf or dissolve into a fine 
mist.  A vampire can use most other Disciplines while shapeshifted, but 
may not cast spells.  Full transformation is not possible during combat, 
although claws can be grown if you are fighting.  While shapeshifted the 
vampire cannot wear any equipment.

The powers available to this Discipline are as follows:
* Umbravision: A combination of truesight shadowsight allows
you to see any hidden charchter accept for monk and ninja.
* Flamehands: This power erupts your hands into flames.
* Earthmeld: Allows you to sink into the ground hiding from enemies.
* Claws: Enables the user to grow inch-long claws on each finger.  These 
claws have no effect if the vampire is armed, however if not they cause 
considerably more damage than a normal unarmed attack.
* Change: Allow the vampire to transform into bat, wolf or mist.  Bat 
form can fly and detect almost everything (invis, hidden, etc).  While in 
wolf form, the vampire enjoys the benefit of an extra 500hp and greatly 
enhanced combat abilities.  Mist form is impervious to attacks and can 
pass through doors.  Beware though, for two vampires in mist form CAN 
attack each other.

Using the Celerity Discipline allows a vampire to move extremely quickly 
and have extra attacks in the same round.

0 FORTITUDE~

Fortitude describes a type of supernatural toughness and vigor which
allows Kindred to resist harm.  Many vampires are very tough and are able
to withstand a lot of injury inflicted by weapons and spells.  However

the weapons from harming them at all.

possess.  This physical might allows the user to inflict much larger

~

0 OBFUSCATE~

When they do not wish to be seen, others rarely notice them even if they 
are standing in plain view.  Though this Discipline affects others minds 
and does not actually render the users invisible, the end result is much 
the same.  Obfuscate is the opposing Discipline to Auspex, and they 
cancel out many of each others powers.

Kindred with this power gain the following advantages:
* Mask: Allows you to disguise yourself as another player.
* Shield: Protects you from the Auspex 'scry' and 'readaura' powers.
* Mortal: Switches between vampire and mortal mode.  While in mortal 
  form, you loose all vampire advantages and disadvantages, and are 
  undetectable from a normal mortal.
* Vanish: allows the player to be invisible to the common eye.
* Conceal: This power hides any object it is used on.
~

0 OBTENEBRATION~

using their powers they are able to switch between the normal world and 
the plane of shadows at will.  They may also view things in both planes 
simultaneously if they so wish.

This Discipline allows the following powers:
Shroud ShadowSight NightSight Shadowstep Lamprey

*Shadowsight: This power allows you to see in the Umbra.
*NightSight: This power allows the kindred to see in the dark.

at your victim entraping them.
~

0 SERPENTIS~

Serpentis is the art of temptation and corruption.  Vampires with this 
Discipline have the ability to tear out their own hearts, rendering 
themselves immune to being staked.  Serpentis users also gain the ability 
to transform themselves into a giant serpent and back at will.  The third 
ability available to vampires with this Discipline is the ability to run 
their tongues along weapons, coating them with a deadly snake venom.

*Darkheart: This allows you to remove your heart, making you
immune to being staked.

~

5 'MASTERY INTRO'~

When a mage wants to write a mastery spell, He must first create a magical
page, a magic pen, a spellbook, and "A Rune of Mastery".
(See Help CREATE MAJOR for more information about this.)
Once they have obtained these tools, they must ready it all to recieve the
power of the Mastery rune, by copying the rune itself onto the page 
(See Help COPY) After the rune has been set, they must hold their pen, and 
write the necessary lines to create a spell. Each line plays a key roll in
the outcome of the spell. If there is even the slightest error in the 
mages scribery, the spell will fail, some have even been known to EXPLODE!
Magic is a powerfull thing, and is not to be toyed with by the weak.

Type HELP 'MASTERY MAGIC' to learn more about these spells, and their
composition.
~

5 COMPOSITION~

Spell composition takes ALOT of time. You must have a pen and a page to
write the spell on.  Each page MUST have a mastery rune copied onto it.

		This will add a line to the Page...(See HELP KEYWORDS)
	WRITE PAGE TITLE (PAGE HEADER)
		This is the title of spell, don't forget where your

0 LEGEND LEGENDS~

Syntax: train legend
Syntax: train   (alone, to see what the costs are for Legend Status)

Legend Status is how well known you are in the world. As you gain Legend
Status, your character becomes stronger.  Fame also confers to its
possessor extra skills not familiar to the unknown.  See LCOMMANDS for
more information.  The cost of Legend Status increases as you gain more
fame. Legend Status costs both experience points and quest points to
train.


The difference of Legend Status between each person fighting is the amount of
extra attacks per round the person with more Legend Status gets. For instance,
Mike with 5 Legend Status, attacks Joe with 2 Legend Status. Mike will get
3 extra attacks per round.

0 CLAIM CALL GIFT LOCATE~
Syntax: claim <object>
Syntax: call <object>
Syntax: call all
Syntax: gift <object> <player>
Syntax: locate

By claiming an object (which costs 500 exp), that object becomes your 
personal property.  Using the 'locate' command you can find what items 
currently belong to you and where they are in the mud.  If you are not 
carrying the item, you can get it back by calling it with the 'call' 
command.  You can change the ownership of your own items by use of the 
'gift' command.
~

0 DECAPITATE TEAR~
Do this to another peasant+ when they are mortally wounded, and you will 
suck out some of their lifeforce (represented by you getting 50% of their exp),
making them mortal again.  You may also loot their corpse, of course, and if you are 
hungry you can even eat their head ;)

Decapitation alone is not enough to completely destroy another peasant 
however, for their head will retain their remaining lifeforce.  To truely 
kill them, you must crack open their head and eat (or in some other way 
destroy) their brain.
~

0 CRACK~
While holding a head in either your left or right hand, typing 'crack' 
will crack the head open, spilling the brains out onto the floor.

0 DEATH~
When your character dies, you are reincarnated back at the Altar of the Temple
of Midgaard.  Your corpse is left behind in the room where you were killed,
together with all of your equipment.  Your gold stays with you.

Any spells which were affecting you are canceled by death.

Following and groups are not affected by death.

You lose experience points for dying.  The amount you lose is half of your 
current amount, so it's a good idea not to hoard exp.

Corpses decay after time, and the objects inside corpses decay with them.
Player corpses last *roughly* 30 hours of game time (15 minutes of real time).
~

0 ESCAPE~
This command allows you to transport to the temple of midgaard when 
mortally wounded.  Unfortunately, it also reduces both your mana and move 
to 0, and informs everyone else on the mud that you are lying defenseless 
at recall...so be careful how you use it.
~

0 MOUNT DISMOUNT~
Syntax: mount <creature>
Syntax: dismount

This allows the character to mount the specified creature.  Only 
creatures such as horses and the like may be mounted, and they will aid 
their rider in combat.

For information on the MOUNT spell, type 'help mountspell'.
~

0 QUESTS~
Quest Makers (and occasionally higher levels) can set quests for one or 
more players to participate in.  The rewards for such quests can be in 
the form of specially modified equipment.  A number of quest points-worth 
will be allocated depending on the difficulty of the quest, using the 
following guidelines for point costs (QP's = Quest Points):

Stats (Str/Dex/Int/Wis/Con): 20 QP's per +1, max allowed is +3 per stat.
Hp/Mana/Move: 5 QP per +1, max allowed is +25 on each.
Hitroll/Damroll: 30 QP's per +1, max allowed is +5 on each.
Ac: 10 QP's per -1, max allowed is -25.

Once a certain affect (str, hitroll, ac, etc) is selected, it cannot be 
chosen again for that item even if you didn't select the maximum allowed 
amount.  Choosing to have penalties on an item will not decrease its 
cost, although some Quest Makers may allow extra points if you select a 
few disadvantages on the item.

For more information, type 'quest'.
~

0 QUEST TOKEN QUESTTOKEN~
Syntax: quest <field> <value>
Syntax: token <value>

QUEST will allow you to spend any quest points you might have.  For a 
list of the cost (in quest points), type 'quest'.

TOKEN will allow you to create a quest token, with the value of the token 
set to the value specified.  The tokens value must be within 1 and 5000, 
and it cannot be greater than the number of quest points you currently 
have.

For information on the QUEST spell, type 'help questspell'.
~

0 QUESTCARD COMPLETE RECHARGE~
Syntax: complete card
Syntax: complete card <object>
Syntax: recharge card machine

A quest card requires 4 objects to complete.  To find out what 4 objects 
you need, type 'complete card'.  When you find these items, you should 
type 'complete card <object>'.  Once you have completed all 4 items on 
the card, #yin order#n, you will be told that you have completed the card.  
Then you should go and find the dark crypt, where there is a machine, and 
type 'recharge card machine'.  You will receive a quest token reward, which 
you should eat, and the card will be recharged with 4 new items to find.

HINT:  Vallandar's tomb can be found by going 2 south, 7 east, 2 north 
from recall.  Once you have found that area, you should look for the 
guardian and solve his riddle, enter the portal he creates, and you'll be 
in the dark crypt.

7 QUEST-TYPES~
The following are a few examples of quest types:
* Find the object/s.  Examples: Find 5 different coloured potions, Find a 
  pitch black longsword that flames brightly, Find a dragon dagger, belt 
  and bracer, etc.
* Kill the mob/s.  These can be hunt down and kill, or simple placing the 
  player in the same room as the mob/s.  Can also be combined with finding 
  objects - Example: Find and kill two different dragons and bring me 
  their claws.
* Solve a puzzle.  For example find a certain room, solve a riddle in an 
  area, or successfully get out of a maze.  These are particularly good 
  when several players of different ability are competing in the quest.
* Duel: A one-on-one fight pitting either a player against a mob, or 
  (more usually) a player against another player.  The conditions will be 
  decided beforehand, and can include any conditions that both sides 
  agree on.  Example: No sanctuary, no potions (or maybe a limited number),
  no spells, no weapons, or whatever.
* Skirmishes: Like a duel, but involves several players on either side.  
  Although the sides don't have to be equal in number, it is generally a 
  good idea to make sure they are roughly equal in power.
* There are also several more obscure quests that can be run - for 
  example you could require that the player brings you 3 small green 
  eggs, then load mob 30005 into the players room.  Another battle might 
  involve no melee - all combat must be with missile weapons.
~

0 EXPERIENCE XP~
Your character advances in power by gaining experience.

#rYou get more exp per kill for each point of status you have.#n

You gain experience by being part of a group that kills someone/something.

You lose experience by dying or being decapitated.

The experience you get from a kill depends on several things: how many players
are in your group; your alignment versus your opponent's alignment; how 
many of this monster have been killed lately (if they are an NPC); and 
some random variation.

See also help on 'status'.
~

0 STATUS~

This represents the 'danger' of the player.  You only have a status if 
you are level 3.  Each time you decapitate an Immortal+ (or an Peasant if you are also a Peasant) your status goes up by 
one and their status goes down by one (to a minimum of zero).  The 
following shows how many kills (minus deaths) you need for each status:

#rYou get more exp per kill for each point of status you have.#n

     0  = Peasant.
 1 - 9  = Page.
10 - 19 = Knight.
20 - 29 = Count.
30 - 39 = VisCount.
40 - 49 = Lord.
50 - 59 = Baron.
60 - 70 = Duke.
71 +	= Prince.
Remember, if your status is Page or above you gain nothing for 
decapitating an Peasant (except a free loot, a head, and an enemy).

~

0 SPELL SPELLS~
Syntax: spells | spell <colour>

This shows your spell casting ability with the various types of magic.

1) Untrained.				 6) An adept.
2) An apprentice.			 7) A mage.
3) A student.				 8) A warlock.

slightly more skilled than another master wizard, and so on.
~

0 GODLESS~
By typing this, you will no longer be affected by most god commands, 
including restore, force, slay, mset, transfer, deny, freeze, etc.  You 
can toggle your godless flag on and off at will, and everyone in the mud 
is informed each time you do this.
~

0 HOME~
To set your recall point, enter the desired room and type 'home here'.  
>From that point on you will recall to that point rather than the Temple 
of Midgaard (although you still go to the Templar Altar if you die).

A home cannot be a safe room.
~

0 PET PETS~
You can buy pets in the pet shop.  Your pet-buying opportunities do not 
accumulate; use them or lost them.  This policy prevents wholesale abuse 
of pets.
~

0 TICK~
Many of the game actions are based upon interval timers, including combat,
most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell duration,
weather, and area resetting.

Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.  Ticks on this mud average 30 seconds of real time, but the actual
amount varies randomly from 15 seconds to 45 seconds.

Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if no one is in the area; less
often (15 minutes) if some one is.  Also note that objects lying on the ground
will not be regenerated if anyone is in the area when it resets.
~

0 !~
Syntax: !

! repeats the last command you typed.
~

0 NORTH SOUTH EAST WEST UP DOWN~
Syntax: north
Syntax: south
Syntax: east
Syntax: west
Syntax: up
Syntax: down

Use these commands to walk in a particular direction.
~

0 CAST~
Syntax: cast <spell> <target>

Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it.  The more you practice,
the higher chance you have of success when casting.  Casting spells costs mana.
The mana cost decreases as your magical ability increases.

The <target> is optional.  Many spells which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat.

If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name.
Example: cast 'cure critic' frag.  Quoting is optional for single-word spells.
You can abbreviate the spell name.

When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.
The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the
saving throw successfully.

See also the help sections for individual spells.
~

0 EXITS~
Syntax: exits

Tells you the visible exits of the room you are in.  Not all exits are visible.
You can use the 'bump' technique to find hidden exits.  (Try to walk in a
certain direction and see what you bump into).
~

0 DROP GET GIVE PUT TAKE~
Syntax: drop <object>
Syntax: drop <amount> coins
Syntax: get  <object>
Syntax: get  <object> <container>
Syntax: give <object> <character>
Syntax: give <amount> coins <character>
Syntax: put  <object> <container>

DROP drops an object, or some coins, on the ground.

GET gets an object, either lying on the ground, or from a container, or even
from a corpse.  TAKE is a synonym for get.

GIVE gives an object, or some coins, to another character.

PUT puts an object into a container.

DROP, GET and PUT understand the object names 'ALL' for all objects and
'ALL.object' for all objects with the same name.
~

0 EQUIPMENT INVENTORY~
Syntax: equipment
Syntax: inventory

EQUIPMENT lists your equipment (armor, weapons, and held items).
INVENTORY lists your inventory.
~

0 COMPARE~
Syntax: compare <object-1> <object-2>
Syntax: compare <object>

COMPARE compares two objects in your inventory.  If both objects are weapons,
it will report the one with the better average damage.  If both objects are
armor, it will report the one with the better armor class.

COMPARE with one argument compares an object in your inventory to the object
you are currently wearing or wielding of the same type.

COMPARE doesn't consider any special modifiers of the objects.
~

0 BACKSTAB BERSERK BS DISARM KICK PUNCH KILL~
Syntax: backstab <character>
Syntax: berserk
Syntax: disarm
Syntax: kick
Syntax: punch    <character>
Syntax: kill     <character>

KILL starts a fight, and, hopefully, kills something.  BACKSTAB is another way
to start a fight, used by thieves.  BS is a synonym for BACKSTAB.

BERSERK will make you strike out at every creature in the room.  It will 
hit players as well as mobiles, so it's a good idea not to use this skill 
while you are grouped.
DISARM is an auxiliary fighting command to disarm your opponent.  Similarly,
KICK will inflict more damage during combat by kicking.
PUNCH will inflict a small amount of damage, and stun your opponent for a 
short period of time.  It also has a chance of breaking your opponents 
nose or jaw.

In order to BACKSTAB, DISARM, KICK or PUNCH successfully, you must practice
the appropriate skill.
~

0 FASTDRAW~

FASTDRAW is automatic, if you have it.  If another player attacks you 
while you have any sheathed weapons, you will draw them out with 
lightning speed and strike your opponent before they are able to land any 
blows on you.  If you have any items in your hands at the time, you will 
throw them aside before drawing your weapons.
~


0 STANCE~
Syntax: combat <style>

In combat, the stance of the fighter plays a very important role; you 
can't just stand there and exchange blow for blow unless you are very 
confident of your ability.  Each fighting stance has advantages and 
disadvantages, the basic outline of which follows:
VIPER: A very fast and aggressive style of combat, concentrating on 
striking your opponent before they have the chance to avoid or block you.
CRANE: A wide, sweeping style of combat, which concentrates on a very 
strong blocking defence.
CRAB: A low, defensive fighting stance which uses agile footwork and 
rolling with attacks in order to reduce your injuries.
MONGOOSE: A light-footed stance, which relies on leaps and acrobatics to 
ensure that by the time your opponent makes their attack, you've moved 
out of the way.
BULL: A low aggressive stance which concentrates purely on physical power.

~

0 ADVANCEDSTANCE~
Syntax: combat <style>

Advanced stances can be learned after you have become a grand master in 
two normal stances.  These stances are much better than the others.
MANTIS: Requires CRANE and VIPER before it can be learned.  This stance 
combines a very strong defence with lightning fast counter attacks.
DRAGON: Requires BULL and CRAB before it can be learned.  This stance 
uses very powerful attacks, as well as protecting the fighter from injury.
TIGER: Requires BULL and VIPER before it can be learned.  Probably the 
most aggressive of all the stances, this style utilizes very powerful and
lightning fast attacks.
MONKEY: Requires CRANE and MONGOOSE before it can be learned.  The only 
affect of this stance is to completely nullify the advantages of your 
opponents stance.
SWALLOW: Requires MONGOOSE and CRAB before it can be learned.  This is 
the most defensive of all the stances, combining agile dodges with the 
ability to 'roll' with an attack, helping prevent injury.

See also help on 'stance' and 'stancetable'.
~

0 SUPERSTANCE~
Superstances are for people who have mastered all other stances.
Eagle: Requires Swallow and Tiger.
Bear: Requires Swallow and Dragon.
Cougar: Requires Mantis and Dragon.
Cobra: Requires Tiger and Dragon.
Rabbit: Requires Swallow and Monkey.

These stances will help to aid a player in combat.

~
0 STANCETABLE~

The following table is a rough comparison of stances, giving a value 
between 10 and -10, where the higher the number the better your chance of 
victory.  Cross-reference your stance from the left with your opponents 
stance from along the top.  Please remember these are only rough 
estimates, and may not be completely accurate...

0 FIGHT STYLE FIGHTSTYLE~
Syntax: fightstyle <number> <style>

This is used for unarmed combat, and it allows the fighter to decide on 
their style of unarmed attack.  Many different types of attack are 
possible, each with different advantages and disadvantages.  Your first 
attack in combat always uses the first number slot.  If you have a second 
attack, this will draw a fighting technique from slots 1 to 4.  If you 
have a third attack, it will draw a fighting technique from slots 5 to 
8.  Any other attacks are randomly drawn from any of slots 1 to 8.  If 
the slot is blank (0) then the attack is a standard unarmed attack.
~

0 HURL~
Syntax: hurl <name>
Syntax: hurl <name> <direction>

This ability allows you to hurl the target into walls, through exits, or 
through doors.  Hurling someone through an exit does a little damage.  
Hurling them into walls does twice as much, and hurling them through 
doors does three times as much.  If you don't specify a direction to hurl 
the target, it will be random (north, south, east or west).  You cannot 
hurl someone who is already injured.
~

0 SCAN SPY THROW~
Syntax: scan
Syntax: spy   <direction>
Syntax: throw <direction> <target>

SCAN allows you to see all the mobs/players within 1 room of you.

SPY allows you to see all the mobs/players within 3 rooms in a specified 
direction.

THROW allows you to hurl an object you are holding (in your right hand, 
or if that's empty left hand) to a target mob/player in a specified 
direction.  The object can be throw up to 3 rooms.  If it fails to reach 
the target by that time it will land on the floor.

For information on the SCAN spell, type 'help scanspell'.
~

0 FLEE RESCUE~
Syntax: flee
Syntax: rescue   <character>

Once you start a fight, you can't just walk away from it.  If the fight
is not going well, you can attempt to FLEE, or another character can
RESCUE you.  (You can also RECALL, but this is less likely to work,
and costs more experience points, then fleeing).

If you lose your link during a fight, then your character will keep
fighting, and will attempt to RECALL from time to time.  Your chances
of making the recall are reduced, and you will lose much more experience.

In order to RESCUE successfully, you must practice the appropriate skill.
~

0 EXAMINE LOOK~
Syntax: look
Syntax: look    <object>
Syntax: look    <character>
Syntax: look    <direction>
Syntax: look    <keyword>
Syntax: look in <container>
Syntax: look in <corpse>
Syntax: examine <container>

~

0 ORDER~
Syntax: order <character> command
Syntax: order all command

ORDER orders one or all of your charmed followers (including pets) to
perform any command.  The command may have arguments.  You are responsible
for the actions of your followers, and others who attack your followers
will incur the same penalty as if they attacked you directly.

Most charmed creatures lose their aggresive nature (while charmed).

If your charmed creature engages in combat, that will break the charm.
~

0 REST SLEEP STAND WAKE~
Syntax: rest
Syntax: sleep
Syntax: stand
Syntax: wake

These commands change your position.  When you REST or SLEEP, you 
regenerate hit points, mana points, and movement points faster.
However, you are more vulnerable to attack, and if you SLEEP,
you won't hear many things happen.

Use STAND or WAKE to come back to a standing position.  You can
also WAKE other sleeping characters.

For info on the sleep spell, type: 'help sleepspell'.
~

0 GTELL ; REPLY SAY TELL~
Syntax: gtell <message>
Syntax: say   <message>
Syntax: tell  <character> <message>

All of these commands send messages to other players.  GTELL sends a message to
all of the characters in your group, wherever they are, even if they are
sleeping or stunned or dying.  ';' is a synonym for GTELL.

SAY sends a message to all awake players in your room.  The single quote '''
is a synonym for SAY.

TELL sends a message to one awake player anywhere in the world.

REPLY sends a message to the last player who sent you a TELL.  REPLY will work
even if you can't see the player, and without revealing their identity.  This
is handy for talking to invisible or switched immortal players.

0 NOTE NOTES BOARD BOARD NOTEWRITE~
Syntax:board [number|name]                     Shows or changes board.
       note                                    Reads next note.
       note read [number]                      Reads a certain note.
       note remove <number>                    Removes a note written by you.
       note list [number]                      Shows up to number notes.
       note write                              Posts a note.
       note catchup                            Marks all notes in this board read.

These commands are used for the new note system. Instead of just one board, 
there are several, each with its special purpose. 

Changing between the boards is accomplished using the BOARD command. BOARD
without any arguments gives you a list of all boards together with number of
unread message. To change, type BOARD <number> or BOARD <name of the board>.
To read next unread note, type NOTE. To read a note with a specified number,
type NOTE READ <number>.  Typing NOTE while in a board with no unread notes 
shifts you to the next board. Note that unlike the standard note system, a 
note has the same number in NOTE LIST and NOTE READ.

Posting a message is as simple as writing NOTE WRITE. You will be moved into 
interactive mode,  where all you see are prompts for the fields like To:, From: etc. 
You will be automatically put AFK while writing a note.

To see the list of the notes in the current board, type NOTE LIST. Typing
NOTE LIST <number> will list only <number> of the last notes in the area.
You can remove your own note by using NOTE REMOVE <number>. Implementors may
remove other people's notes. Implementors can also select how many  days
their note is kept before being purged. Purging happens automatically at
bootup. Purged notes are not deleted, but saved into a file.

To let only immortals see your note, address it to "imm".

This board system was created by Erwin S. Andreasen, erwin@pip.dknet.dk, aka
Phunk and is freely available. The general outlook was based on Mystic 
Adventure's note system (mud.gel.ulaval.ca 4000).

These commands send messages through communication channels to other players.

SHOUT sends a message to all awake players in the world.  To curb excessive
shouting, SHOUT imposes a three-second delay on the shouter.

AUCTION, CHAT, MUSIC, and QUESTION and ANSWER also send messages to all
interested players.  '.' is a synonym for CHAT.  The QUESTION and ANSWER
commands both use the same 'question' channel

YELL sends a message to all awake players within your area.

You can use the CHANNELS command to hear, or not hear, any of these channels.

inventory.

You may not be able to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD an item if its alignment does not
match yours, if it is too heavy for you, or if you are not experienced enough
to use it properly.

REMOVE will take any object from your equipment and put it back into your
inventory.

0 PROMPT CPROMPT~

This command allows you to configure your prompt.  The PROMPT command 
will set your standard prompt.  You also have the option of having a 
combat prompt, CPROMPT, which will appear while fighting.  If no cprompt 
is defined, the standard prompt will be used for both conditions.
The following options are available:

0 PRIMAL~

Primal energy is the ultimate form of energy in the multiverse, the one 
from which all other energies are derived.  Unfortunately, unlike mana, 
primal energy is only one use, and is generally used for very powerful

0 NEWBIE~
A newbie is a player that is under 10 hours with no class or status. 
If you cap a player under 10 hours you will automatically be paradoxed,
and the newbie will be restored and the decap will not work on him. 
However if the newbie decides to get status he is fair game.

Note classed people under 10 hours with no status are NOT considered
newbies with regards to decapping or bonus exp.

Newbies get *3 exp for the first 10 hours regardless of if they are classed.

QUIT leaves the game.  You may QUIT anywhere, although there is an experience
penalty for quitting outside of Midgaard.  When you re-enter the game you will
be back in the same room.

QUIT automatically does a SAVE, so you can safely leave the game with just one
command.  Nevertheless it's a good idea to SAVE before QUIT.  If you get into
the habit of using QUIT without SAVE, and then you play some other mud that
doesn't save before quitting, you're going to regret it.

There is no RENT in this mud.  Just SAVE and QUIT whenever you want to leave.

-1 IMC~
IMC (Inter-Mud Communication) provides a way for muds to connect together and
share various services: chat channels, tells, notes, who listings, and so on.

The available mortal-level IMC commands are as follows. See the help topics
for each of these for more information.

- IMCLIST : get a list of active muds that are connected to IMC.
- RCHAT   : send a message on the common chat channel.
- RWHO    : send a who request to a mud.
- RTELL   : send a tell to someone on another mud.
- RREPLY  : reply to a rtell from someone on another mud.
- RQUERY  : ask for information of some type from another mud.
- RBEEP   : "beep" another player. Use sparingly.
- RWHOIS  : find someone on IMC
- RFINGER : get information about a player on another mud
- ISTATS  : get some (interesting?) stats about IMC.
- RCHAN   : show which channels you are listening to, and modify that state.

There is also provision for inter-mud notes/mail; see 'IMC NOTES'.

IMC2 was written by Oliver Jowett <oliver@sa-search.massey.ac.nz>, aka
Spectrum. Mail me if you're interested in connecting to the IMC network.
The source code is available at ftp://sa-search.massey.ac.nz/pub/mud/imc2/

~

0 IMCLIST~
Syntax:  imclist                  - get a list of active muds on IMC
         imclist direct           - get a list of directly connected muds
         imclist config           - see the local IMC config
         imclist routes           - See the current routes for everyone.

'imclist' lists active muds on IMC. It lists all the muds which this mud knows
about on the IMC network, and when they were last heard from. The 'route'
section is mainly for diagnostics, and indicates the route that your mud will
send packets via to get to another mud.

'imclist direct' shows direct connections from your mud to other muds.

'imclist config' shows the local IMC configuration and state.

See also: IMC RQUERY
~

7 IMCFLAGS~
o  client: only accept connections from this mud, don't ever try to connect
o  noauto: don't try to connect on startup
o  reconnect: automatically try to reconnect every 30 minutes if a connection
   is lost to this mud (2 minute delay for the first attempt).
o  broadcast: if a packet is destined for this mud specifically, then broadcast
   it anyway. Normally in this case the packet is sent only to the mud; if
   there is a faster or more reliable link to the mud elsewhere you probably
   want to use this option as a backup.
o  deny: don't _ever_ allow connections to this mud. Useful if (for 
   example) a mud is crashing due to an IMC bug, and you need to cut it off.
o  new: temporary flag used in hubswitching, should never be set manually
o  hub: all connections which are hub connections will be given this flag,
   when a hub, or a mud acting as a hub, is detected.
o  noswitch: sometimes it is not desirable to switch to a specific hub.
   it may be unstable, on the other side of the world, on the other side
   of a firewall or have a very slow or troublesome internet connection.
   creating an entry in the config file with the NOSWITCH and NOAUTO flags
   will keep the hub from being used in the hub switching process.

The "IMC SET connection FLAGS flag" acts as a toggle, that is you use
the same command to turn the flag off, as you did to turn it on. 

example:

turn flags on:
   imc set BadHub flags noswitch noauto - dont hubswitch to this one.
turn flags off:
   imc set BadHub flags noswitch noauto - it's fixed, go ahead and hub switch.

0 RCHAT RIMM RCODE~
These channels are obselete, use ICE instead.
~

0 RWHO~
Syntax:  rwho <mudname>               - ask for a who listing from another mud

'rwho' asks the given mud for a 'who' listing of its current players. Depending
on the network, it may take several seconds to get a response. You should use
the mud abbreviation listed in 'imclist' when issuing a rwho.

See also: IMC IMCLIST RQUERY RWHOIS
~

0 RWHOIS~
Syntax:  rwhois <playername>          - find a player on IMC

'rwhois' asks all muds on IMC for a player with the given name. You should not
include a @mudname section - just the playername. Replies will be returned
from those muds who have a player by that name connected.

See also: IMC RWHO RFINGER
~

0 RFINGER~
Syntax:  rfinger <player@mudname>     - get information about a player

'rfinger' asks the specified mud for information about the specified player.
The information you will get back (and even its existance) depends on the
remote mud, but will typically give at least their last login time.

See also: IMC RWHO RWHOIS
~

0 RTELL RREPLY~
Syntax:  rtell <player@mudname> <message>    - send a 'tell' to another player
         rreply <message>                    - send a 'tell' to the last player
                                               to send you a rtell

rtell and rreply are the IMC equivalents of tell and reply, and work nearly
identically. To rtell, however, you need to supply both a playername and a
mudname (as shown in 'imclist'). rreply will reply to the last rtell you
received from a player - even if that player was invisible to you.

See also: IMC IMCLIST
~

0 RQUERY~
Syntax:  rquery <mudname> help         - ask for available rquery options
         rquery <mudname> <option>     - ask for information from a mud

RQuery is similar to rwho, except it requests different information from a
mud. Each mud differs in what information it supplies, but 'rquery <mudname>
help' will give you a list of options that you can ask for.

Typically at least the following are supported:

rquery <mud> who        - ask for a who listing, identical to 'rwho'
rquery <mud> info       - get general information on the mud, usually including
                          its address. This is the preferred way of finding
                          out the address of a mud on IMC - don't ask on rchat!
rquery <mud> list       - ask for a list of IMC connections, from that mud's
                          point of view. Identical to 'imclist' on the remote
                          mud.
rquery <mud> istats     - ask for some IMC statistics, identical to 'istats' on
                          the remote mud.

See also: IMC IMCLIST RWHO
~

0 RBEEP~
Syntax:  rbeep <player@mudname>     - "beep" a player over IMC

rbeep sends an audible beep to another player on another mud (the @mudname
part indicates which mud; see 'imclist'). Note that this should only be done
when you _really_ need to get their attention; abusing rbeep will usually
lead to your IMC priviliges being revoked.

See also: IMC IMCLIST
~

7 ISTATS~
Syntax:  istats                     - display use(less?) statistics

istats shows some (maybe :) interesting statistics about how much traffic your
mud is generating due to IMC.

See also: IMC IMCLIST RQUERY
~

0 RCHANNELS RCHAN RINVIS~
Syntax:  rchannels                  - display your current IMC channel state
         rchannels +<channel>       - turn on an IMC channel
         rchannels -<channel>       - turn off an IMC channel

rchannels on its own will show you which IMC channels you have access to, and
whether they are currently on or off.

rchannels with an argument will turn on or off a given IMC channel that you
have access to.

rchannels can also be used to block rtells and rbeeps if necessary.

One additional option is rinvis. rchannels +rinvis will make you totally
invisible to IMC: you cannot be contacted by rtell, rreply, or rbeep, and
you do not appear on rwho. However, you cannot use any IMC channels while
rinvis is active (you can still hear them, though). rchannels -rinvis will
reverse this state.

Immortals may allow you access to IMC channels, or revoke your access to 
them, as necessary.

See also: IMC RCHAT RBEEP RTELL
~

7 'IMC NOTES'~
Notes (boards, mail, etc) are very mud-dependent, but in general, if they
have been connected to IMC, then you can simply write notes to player@mudname
in addition to normal 'player'.

For example, you may be able to do:

note to abcde@somemud anotherplayer immortal@someothermud

and the note would go to:
  abcde on the mud called 'somemud'
  anotherplayer on your mud
  all immortals on the mud called 'someothermud'

The 'playernames' used are interpreted by the mud that receives them, not
your mud, so be careful when writing notes to group names such as 'immortal'.

If your note cannot be delivered within 12 hours for some reason (if the
mud is down, does not exist, or refused your mail) then you will get a note
from the system telling you so.

7 'IMC IMMORTAL COMMANDS' RINFO~
IMC Immortal commands:

- RINFO       : A channel which the various hubs put status reports onto. Can
                be spammy at times; you may want to turn off rinfo for this
                reason.
- RSOCKETS    : displays debugging info on the current IMC connection state.
- RCONNECT    : force a connection to a directly connected mud.
- RDISCONNECT : forcibly disconnect a directly connected mud.
- RIGNORE     : ignore a player or an entire mud on IMC.
- MAILQUEUE   : show the current queue of pending inter-mud notes.
- IMC         : edit the IMC configuration for your mud (see 'IMC CONFIG')
- RCHANSET    : manage access to IMC channels/rtell/rbeep for players.
- RPING       : trace IMC connectivity

See also: IMC
~

7 RSOCKETS~
Syntax:  rsockets                   - display IMC socket usage

rsockets displays the current connection state for the direct IMC connections
that your mud has. The various fields are:

Desc  : the system-level descriptor used for this connection

Mud   : which mud this connection is for

State : how far through the connection process this connection is:
        - connecting: waiting for the other end to accept our TCP connection
        - wait1:      waiting for the password from an incoming client
        - wait2:      waiting for the server to respond to our password
        - connected:  the connection is completely 'up'

Inbuf : the size of data waiting in the input and output queues for this
Outbuf: connection.

Spam1 : spam-protection counters
Spam2 :

See also: IMC 'IMC IMMORTAL COMMANDS'
~

7 RCONNECT~
Syntax:  rconnect <mudname>                - start an IMC connection

rconnect will initiate a connection to the given mud. Note that this has to
be a _directly_ connected mud (ie. a mud in the first section of imclist).
Feedback on the state of the connection will be logged to 'wiznet imc', and 
you may want to check imclist to see if it was successful.

See also: IMC 'IMC IMMORTAL' RDISCONNECT
~

7 RDISCONNECT~
Syntax:  rdisconnect <mudname>             - terminate an IMC connection

rdisconnect reverses rconnect, severing all connections to the named mud.

See also: IMC 'IMC IMMORTAL COMMANDS' RCONNECT
~

7 RIGNORE~
Syntax:  rignore                           - list current rignores
         rignore ignore  <pattern>         - ignore player(s) or mud(s)
         rignore notrust <pattern>         - don't trust player(s) or mud(s)
	 rignore delete  <pattern>         - remove a rignore

rignore ignores or restricts the access, at a mud-wide level, everything
coming in over IMC for a specified player or group of players. Currently
two possible actions are possible: ignore and notrust.

Ignore means:

- rtells/rbeeps/rwhos will be ignored, and a rtell sent back to say that the
  mud is ignoring them.
- no messages from them on rchat, rcode, etc will appear on your mud.

Notrust means:

- any rwho/rfinger/etc requests from a mud/player matching the pattern will
  be treated as if they were from a level 1 mortal - ie. wizi imms will never
  be revealed on rwho, and rtells won't see them, etc.
- any incoming channel messages from something matching the pattern are
  stripped of wizi status - they will be visible to everyone in general.

Patterns can be one of:

  player@mud              - matches a specific player at a specific mud
  *suffix                 - matches anything ending with that suffix
                            (commonly used as *@mud)
  prefix*                 - matches anything beginning with that prefix
                            (for example, player@*)
  *substring*             - matches anything containing that substring

Use with care.

See also: IMC 'IMC IMMORTAL COMMANDS'
~

7 MAILQUEUE~
Syntax:  mailqueue                         - show current IMC mailqueue

This command simply shows the current contents of the outgoing IMC mailqueue
for inter-mud notes. Due to the internal implementation of this (static
buffers - ick), only the first 8-9 entries will be shown.

7 RCHANSET~
Syntax:  chanset <player>             - see a players current IMC flags
         chanset <player> +<channel>  - set 'allow' flag on a player
         chanset <player> -<channel>  - set 'deny' flag on a player
         chanset <player> =<channel>  - reset allow/deny flags on a player

This command allows you to view or change a players IMC channel priviliges.
In all cases <channel> can be the name of an IMC channel (rchat, rcode, etc)
or 'rtell' or 'rbeep'.

Setting the allow flag for a channel allows that player to see and use that
channel, regardless of their level. This can be used, for example, to give
mortals with coding experience access to rcode.

Setting the deny flag for a channel prevents that player from using or
seeing that channel, even if their level normally allows them to. This can be
used as a penalty for players who abuse the IMC channels or rtell/rbeep.

Resetting the allow/deny flags simply clears them, using only the player's
level to determing whether they can use the channel.

7 'IMC CONFIG'~
The 'imc' command is used to configure your IMC setup:

Syntax:  imc add <mudname>            - add a new IMC connection entry
         imc set <...>                - set the details of an IMC connection
         imc delete <mudname>         - remove an IMC connection
         imc rename <old> <new>       - rename an IMC connection
         imc reload                   - load a new IMC config file from disk
	 imc hubswitch                - turn off all hub switching
         imc log                      - turn off all log messages
         imc localname <name>         - set the local IMC name
         imc localport <port>         - set the local IMC port

Add, delete, and rename should be self-explanatory. The name of an IMC
connection MUST match the name which the other end is using.

Reload destroys the version of the configuration in memory, and reloads it
from disk. This is useful if you have hand-edited the config file and want
to load your changes without rebooting. 'imc reload' also reloads the
rignores file.

The set command has several forms:

imc set <mudname> all <data...>     - set all values for a mud
                  host <hostname>   - set the hostname to connect to
                  port <portnum>    - set the remote IMC port to connect to
                  clientpw <pw>     - set the case-sensitive client password
                  serverpw <pw>     - set the case-sensitive server password
                  rcvstamp <value>  - set the receivestamp
                  noforward <value> - set the noforward bitmask
                  flags <value>     - set the connection flags

The 'all' form takes a series of values:

imc set <mudname> all <host> <port> <clientpw> <serverpw> <rcvstamp>
                      <noforward> <flags>

For information on the exact details of each field, see the IMC documentation.

The localname and localport commands set the IMC name and port of -your- mud.
Use with care.

IMC HUBSWITCH requires an IMC RELOAD to take affect.
